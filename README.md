# activeUserDirectoryChecker
Checks directory emails against another database to see that all emails are active.


you'll need to include your database credentials in a database file. I named mine ```db.php```

//database 1 that you'll check for activity
$vUser = 1st database username
$vPass = 1st database password
$vLoc = 1st database location/ip address
$vdata = 1st database name


//Site checking credentials
$siteUser = 2nd database username
$sitePass = 2nd database password
$siteLoc = 2nd database location/ip address
$siteDB = 2nd database name
