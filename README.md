# activeUserDirectoryChecker
Checks directory emails against another database to see that all emails are active.

you'll need to include your database credentials in a database file. I named mine ```db.php```

##database 1 that you'll check for activity<br>
$vUser = 1st database username<br>
$vPass = 1st database password<br>
$vLoc = 1st database location/ip address<br>
$vdata = 1st database name<br>

##Site checking credentials<br>
$siteUser = 2nd database username<br>
$sitePass = 2nd database password<br>
$siteLoc = 2nd database location/ip address<br>
$siteDB = 2nd database name<br>
